# 🏃 Strava Fitness Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Strava smart fitness device data to understand user activity patterns, calorie expenditure, and overall fitness behavior.  
The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using SQL, Python, and Power BI, suitable for internship and entry-level data analyst roles.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze daily fitness activity data collected from smart devices
- Identify trends in steps, calories burned, and activity intensity
- Understand weekday-wise activity behavior
- Create interactive dashboards for better insights
- Provide data-driven business and fitness recommendations

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV Dataset

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains daily fitness activity records captured from smart fitness devices.

### Key Attributes
- User ID
- Activity Date
- Total Steps
- Total Distance
- Calories Burned
- Very Active Minutes
- Fairly Active Minutes
- Lightly Active Minutes
- Sedentary Minutes

Each record represents a user’s daily activity summary.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format
- Checked and handled missing values
- Verified data consistency across numeric features
- Created derived columns such as:
  - Day Name
  - Day Number (for weekday sorting)

### 2️⃣ SQL Analysis
- Calculated average daily steps
- Analyzed total and average calories burned
- Identified day-wise activity trends
- Documented queries and insights in a SQL analysis report

### 3️⃣ Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed data exploration using Pandas
- Created visualizations for steps, calories, and activity intensity
- Analyzed relationship between steps and calories

### 4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
- KPI Cards (Steps, Calories, Active Minutes)
- Day-wise activity trends
- Activity intensity distribution
- Interactive slicers (Date, Day Name, User ID)

## 📈 Key Insights
- Activity levels vary across different days
- Weekdays show higher engagement
- Sedentary behavior dominates overall activity
- Strong correlation between steps and calories burned

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Reduce sedentary time using reminders
- Introduce weekday-based fitness challenges
- Personalize goals based on user behavior
- Use dashboards for continuous monitoring

## 📂 Project Deliverables
- SQL Script File
- SQL Analysis PDF
- Python Notebook
- Python Analysis PDF
- Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)
- Power BI Dashboard PDF
- Final Project Report PDF

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline using SQL, Python, and Power BI, enabling data-driven fitness and business insights.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate sleep and heart-rate data
- Apply machine learning for activity prediction
- Automate dashboard refresh
- Extend analysis to longer time periods
